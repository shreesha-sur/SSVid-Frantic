# SSVid-Frantic
Frantic fish behaviour dataset
The study attempts to models the frantic fish behaviour. In this regard, a large aquarium is setup and wild caught Sillago sihama is used. Frantic patterns are characterised by sudden changes in swim direction and speed. This particular pattern is important in aquaculture as it the initial behaviour displayed by fishes under stress. Thus, detecting these behaviour and taking preventive measures can aid in increasing harvest and sustainability in aquaculture. 
The dataset must be used for research purpose only.
The datset contains 16 videos, 7 for training and 9 for testing. Each video varies from 10-30 seconds in duration and are captured at 12fps.
