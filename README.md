# SSVid-Frantic
Frantic fish behaviour dataset:
The dataset is aimed to model the frantic fish behaviour. In this regard, a large aquarium is setup and wild caught Sillago sihama is used. Frantic patterns are characterised by sudden changes in swim direction and speed. This particular pattern is important in aquaculture as it the initial behaviour displayed by fishes under stress. Thus, detecting these behaviour and taking preventive measures can aid in increasing harvest and sustainability in aquaculture. 
The dataset must be used for research purpose only.
The datset contains 16 videos, 7 for training and 9 for testing. Each video varies from 10-30 seconds in duration and are captured at 12fps.
Objective is to detect each frame as normal or frantic. Normal frames are coded as 0 and the frantic frames are coded as 1.
All the training set videos contain only normal patterns. The test set contains videos containing normal and frantic patterns. 
=======================================================================================
Another set of videos are provided that are collected from real aquaculture cage. This set contains videos that normal and frantic. 
This set of videos can be used to test the developed in real cage scenario. 
The fish species used in the study are Tilapia.
=======================================================================================
We also provide the water quality parameters data for developing prediction model.
The dataset consist of 7235 smaple values of Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen and Salinity.
The values are sampled for every 90 moinutes. The objective of this dataset is to develop forecasting models for aquaculture.
One can use Deep learning or Hybrid models to predict the water quality parameters.
